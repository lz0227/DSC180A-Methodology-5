1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
   I think the most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the idea of prompt engineering. We explored different chain-of-thoughts prompting methods for generative AI to get better responses.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
   A potential investigation is to dive deeper into how we combine generative AI and predictive AI in the context of disinformation and misinformation. Even though we started this in quarter one, I think there is much more to explore
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
   A potential change I would make is how we approach our predictive model. Instead of using it as an individual component, we might integrate it into our generative model as an objective function for our prompting method.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
   I would be interested in using more sophisticated machine learning models for our predictive model side to get more accurate responses. I also want to explore other prompting techniques other than chain-of-thought so that we can compare the responses our generative AI outputs and chose the best for our final product.
